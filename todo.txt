SALJA Evolution Map — Audit-Driven Improvements
Philosophy: File-based calendar conversion CLI for power users and developers. Data fidelity configurable. Interactive-first.
================================================================================

--- PHASE: STREAMING & SCALE ---

(B) Add a Close() method to StreamingCSVParser and StreamingICSParser in internal/errors/streaming.go for proper resource cleanup +refactor
(B) Integrate StreamingCSVParser into CSV parsers as an optional mode triggered when file size exceeds a configurable threshold (default 10MB) in config +feature
(B) Refactor internal/conflict/detector.go to use sorted-merge or hash-based matching when item count exceeds 1000 to avoid O(n²) degradation +refactor

--- PHASE: PROGRESS & UX ---

(B) Fix the progress bar bug in cmd/salja/commands/convert.go where the bar loop increments without doing actual work — move progress updates to wrap individual item conversion within WriteOutput +refactor
(B) Add item-count summary to all commands that process files: show "Converted N events, M tasks (K warnings)" at the end of convert, validate, and diff +feature
(B) Add a --format flag to the diff command in cmd/salja/commands/diff.go that supports "table" (default), "json", and "patch" output styles +feature

--- PHASE: BUILD QUALITY ---

(B) Fix Go version mismatch: update .github/workflows/ci.yml to use the same Go version specified in go.mod instead of hardcoded 1.22 +infra
(B) Add golangci-lint to .github/workflows/ci.yml lint job instead of only running go vet, using the golangci/golangci-lint-action GitHub Action +infra
(B) Add go test -race flag to the test job in .github/workflows/ci.yml to catch data races in conflict resolver and token store +infra
(B) Add test coverage reporting to .github/workflows/ci.yml using go test -coverprofile and upload as a GitHub Actions artifact +infra
(B) Add a make lint target to Makefile that fails the build if golangci-lint is installed and reports errors, instead of silently skipping +infra
