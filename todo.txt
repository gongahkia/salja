(B) Add timeout configuration for API calls in internal/api so that GCalClient and MSGraphClient respect a configurable timeout from Config instead of hardcoded 30 seconds +feature +api
(B) Add rate limiting awareness to sync push commands so that batch event creation respects Google Calendar API quota (calendar.events.insert: 10 QPS) and Microsoft Graph limits +feature +api
(B) Add integration tests for the convert command that verify round-trip conversion ICS→CSV→ICS preserves all fields that both formats support +infra +testing
(B) Add integration tests for the convert command that verify round-trip conversion between every pair of registered formats and assert that DataLossWarnings match expected field losses +infra +testing
(B) Add benchmark tests for CSV and ICS parsers with 10000-item files to establish baseline performance and detect regressions +infra +testing
